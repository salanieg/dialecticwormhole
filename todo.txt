-------------- BUGS --------------

navigation buttons sometimes do weird things

-------------- IMPROVEMENTS --------------

meta descriptions

add explicit height and width to images

-------------- ADDITIONS --------------

make img redirect random
would only be useful if amount of underpages succeeds a certain stochastical threshold, so it is unlikely to be redirected to the same site again (would be seen as bug)
